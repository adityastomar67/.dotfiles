  <h2>Module: Suckless Terminal.</h1>
  Brief description of how this sub configuration actually works.
</div>

#### Dependencies
```bash
# Void
xbps-install libXft-devel libX11-devel harfbuzz-devel libXext-devel libXrender-devel libXinerama-devel

# Debian (and ubuntu probably)
apt install build-essential libxft-dev libharfbuzz-dev

# most of these are already installed on Arch based distros
```

#### Installation

This version ST uses preprocessor directives to decide whether or not to include a patch during build time. Essentially this means that this build, for better or worse, contains both the patched _and_ the original code. The aim being that you can select which patches to include and the build will contain that code and nothing more.

For example to include the `alpha` patch then you would only need to flip this setting from 0 to 1 in [patches.h](https://github.com/adityastomar67/.dotfiles/blob/master/.config/st/patches.def.h):
```c
#define ALPHA_PATCH 1
```

Once you have found out what works for you and what doesn't then you should be in a better position to choose patches should you want to start patching from scratch.

Refer to [https://st.suckless.org/](https://st.suckless.org/) for details on the st terminal, how to install it and how it works.

#### To Install ST alone frome this config, run this command (Coming Soon!!)
```bash
curl -sL https://bit.ly/Fresh-Install | sh -s -- --st
```

#### For Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityastomar67/.dotfiles.git /tmp/dots
cp -r /tmp/dots/.config/st $HOME/.config/st
cd ~/.config/st
sudo make install
xrdb merge pathToXresourcesFile
```
> TIP: Put the xrdb merge command in your wm's autostart or similar

      - allows st to reize to any pixel size rather than snapping to character width / height

   - [~anysize_nobar~](https://github.com/connor-brooks/st-anysize-nobar)
      - ~a patch that aims to prevent black bars being drawn on the edges of st terminals using the
        anysize patch~

   - [background-image](https://st.suckless.org/patches/background_image/)
      - draws a background image in farbfeld format in place of the defaultbg color allowing for
        pseudo transparency

      - allows the use of a blinking cursor

   - [bold-is-not-bright](https://st.suckless.org/patches/bold-is-not-bright/)

      - this patch makes bold text rendered simply as bold, leaving the color unaffected

   - [boxdraw](https://st.suckless.org/patches/boxdraw/)
      - adds dustom rendering of lines/blocks/braille characters for gapless alignment

   - [clipboard](https://st.suckless.org/patches/clipboard/)

      - allows st to be resized without cutting off text when the terminal window is made larger again

   - [csi_23_23](https://st.suckless.org/patches/csi_22_23/)
      - adds support for CSI escape sequences 22 and 23, which save and restores the window title
        (for instance nvim does this when opening and closing)

   - default-cursor
      - minor change allowing escape sequences like `\e[ q` or `\e[0 q` to set the cursor back to default configuration instead of a blinking block
      - while many terminals do this the behaviour is not according to the specification

   - [delkey](https://st.suckless.org/patches/delkey/)
      - return BS on pressing backspace and DEL on pressing the delete key

   - [externalpipein](https://lists.suckless.org/hackers/2004/17218.html)
      - this patch prevents the reset of the signal handler set on SIGCHILD, when the forked process that executes the external process exits
      - it adds the externalpipein function to redirect the standard output of the external command to the slave size of the pty, that is, as if the external program had been manually executed on the terminal
      - this can be used to send desired escape sequences to the terminal with a shortcut (e.g. to change colors)

   - [~fixime~](https://st.suckless.org/patches/fix_ime/)
      - adds better Input Method Editor (IME) support
      - (included in the base as per [35f7db](https://git.suckless.org/st/commit/e85b6b64660214121164ea97fb098eaa4935f7db.html))

      - hides the terminal cursor when the window loses focus (as opposed to showing a hollow cursor)

   - [invert](https://st.suckless.org/patches/invert/)
      - adds a keybinding that lets you invert the current colorscheme of st
      - this provides a simple way to temporarily switch to a light colorscheme if you use a dark colorscheme or visa-versa

   - [iso14755](https://st.suckless.org/patches/iso14755/)

        ~implemented in most other terminals (e.g libvte, kitty)~
      - ~specifically it differs from~ [~osc_10_11_12~](https://st.suckless.org/patches/osc_10_11_12/)
        ~in that it treats the background and foreground colors as distinct from palette colours 01~
        ~and 07 in order to facilitate the use of theme setting scripts like~
        [~theme.sh~](https://github.com/lemnos/theme.sh) ~which expect these colours to be distinct~

      - allows you scroll back through terminal output using keyboard shortcuts or mousewheel

   - sixel
      - this patch adds SIXEL graphics support

   - st-embedder
      - this patch allows clients to embed into the st window and can be useful if you tend to
        start X applications from the terminal
      - the behavior is similar to Plan 9 where applications can take over windows

   - [spoiler](https://st.suckless.org/patches/spoiler/)
      - use inverted defaultbg/fg for selection when bg/fg are the same

   - [swapmouse](https://st.suckless.org/patches/swapmouse/)

      - it emulates the behaviour shown by vte terminals like termite

   - [sync](https://st.suckless.org/patches/sync/)
      - adds synchronized-updates/application-sync support in st
      - this has no effect except when an application uses the synchronized-update escape sequences

   - [vim-browse](https://st.suckless.org/patches/vim_browse/)
      - the vim-browse patch offers the possibility to move through the terminal history-buffer,
        search for strings using VIM-like motions, operations and quantifiers
      - it overlays the screen with highlighted search results and displays the current operation
        / motions / search string in the bottom right corner

   - [visualbell](https://st.suckless.org/patches/visualbell/)
      - adds visual indicators for the terminal bell event

   - [w3m](https://st.suckless.org/patches/w3m/)
      - adds support for w3m images

   - [wide-glyphs](https://www.reddit.com/r/suckless/comments/jt90ai/update_support_for_proper_glyph_rendering_in_st/)

        that is too wide in programs that use Xft, for example Inconsolata v3.000

        Xft library itself

   - [workingdir](https://st.suckless.org/patches/workingdir/)
      - allows user to specify the initial path st should use as the working directory

   - [xresources](https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/)
